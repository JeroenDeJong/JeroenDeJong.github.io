# 1. Introduction

Over the years the world has changed, with globalization playing a major role. Globalization has led to a growth in cheaper and more varied products, partly because contact with people spread around the world has become increasingly easier and this has created a &#39;global community&#39; in which everyone can still have their own culture and identity. This global community can be seen as a community in which small actions of individuals and groups are taken among themselves, in order to bring about all kinds of developments (Williams, Meth, &amp; Willis, 2014). These developments are increasingly pointing towards a _global urban world_, in which movement of ideas, goods and people are increasingly becoming normalized.

Within this globalization, a distinction has been made between the North and South of the world called the Global North and the Global South, a separation of countries with different interpretations circulating around the world. The image below shows the separation according to Willy Brandt where there is a clear distinction made between the &#39;rich&#39; and the &#39;poor&#39; (Williams, Meth, &amp; Willis, 2014).


_Figure 1: The division of the Global North and the Global South according to Brandt_ (Williams, Meth, &amp; Willis, 2014)_. _

Contemporary thinking looks beyond the &#39;rich&#39; and the &#39;poor&#39;, which are generalising claims with little context and scientific value. According to Williams, the Global South will therefore need to be seen as a part of the world in which there is a response to new social, economic and political flows from elsewhere and a continuous process of reinvention and negotiation of identities in local environments takes place (Williams, Meth, &amp; Willis, 2014).

These new flows and processes in which reinvention takes place have increasingly emerged over the years and can be seen as the force to keep evolving. A great example of redevelopment and innovation, especially in the technological field, is _leapfrogging_, the topic that is the focus of this research. The essence of this terminology comes from the idea of a frog making a (big) leap. The Cambridge dictionary describes the term to leap as: &quot;to make a large jump or sudden movement, usually from one place to another_&quot;_ (Cambridge University Press, 2021)_._ The concept can therefore simply be explained as one actor making a large forward movement in relation to another actor. It is seen as a process in which intermediary steps are outdated and the adoption of modern systems takes place (Leapfrog Soluciones WEB EIRL, 2021). This research will elaborate further on the details and various methods of leapfrogging in Chapter 3.

This is often more difficult than can be imagined, which is why there is often still the thought of taking a logical next step to achieve a certain development, often unnecessarily. This principle is also called path dependency. According to Caroline Banton, path dependency arises as follows: &quot;Path dependency occurs because it is often easier or more cost-effective to continue along an already set path than to create an entirely new one (Banton, 2021).&quot; Historically, this path dependency is used for several development and investment projects. From tech solutions and education to the planning of industries and infrastructure, much development has been focussed on getting African countries to function to the standard of the Global North, effectively implementing existing concepts and technologies onto places that lacked these - as if a developing country just had to grab the first world&#39;s checklist and tick off all boxes until &#39;developed&#39; status has been reached. Many of these technological &#39;copy + paste&#39; exercises have failed. A lack of proper assessment of place, space, culture and, perhaps most importantly, specific wants and needs for change, often leads to mismatches between supply and demand (Blimpo, et al., 2017).

There is however a lot of excitement building over Africa&#39;s future. Many leaders in various countries have called the next decade (this decade) as &quot;Africa&#39;s decade&quot; (Maimane, 2017).Therefore, the goal in this research is to examine this excitement and examine other ways for developing countries to innovate in ways that communities, businesses, and investors thrive. These innovations and developments through leapfrogging, could possibly bring us a step closer to _a global urban world._ To this end, the following research question was formulated:

_ **How does leapfrogging towards technological advancements affect and impact the growth in various sectors in Africa over the next decade?** _

Answering the question was done through an extensive literature review in which more information was given about the basic concept of leapfrogging, best practices in leapfrogging in different sectors and the future of leapfrogging. In the research, additional information was gathered in a qualitative way. This was done by conducting expert interviews to paint a broader picture of the concept of leapfrogging and its future. The data gathered from the literature review and the additional interviews have been used to make a documentary. The literature review can be found in chapter 3, the conceptual approach in chapter 4, the empirical findings in chapter 5, the storyboard of the documentary will be presented in Chapter 6 and the post-script analysis can be found in chapter 7.

**2. Methodological approach**

The outcome of this project will be expressed in a multimedia product in the form of a documentary. This documentary will be around ten minutes long and will, together with this report, answer the following question:

_ **How does leapfrogging towards technological advancements affect and impact the growth in various sectors in Africa over the next decade?** _

To answer this question, sub questions are set up to further explore the main question. These questions are answered by interviews with experts and literature research.

1. In which sectors has leapfrogging taken place in the past and will do in the future?
2. What are the prerequisites for a successful &#39;leap&#39;?
3. What are leapfrogging opportunities for Africa in the next decade?

The first sub question is aimed on the different sectors that are important when it comes to leapfrogging and is important for finding out in which sector leapfrogging is possible and most likely successful. In addition, it is important to find out what current leapfrogging projects look like and how that differs from leapfrogging projects that have taken place in the past. The second sub question is focused on the &#39;lay-out&#39; of a leapfrogging project; what are necessities that make leapfrogging possible? The third sub question is focused on the future of Africa when it comes to leapfrogging. This question is answered by conducting semi-structured interviews with experts of which the results can be found in chapter 5.

The sub questions are answered using both semi-structured interviews with experts and literature research. Therefore, several books and articles, written by these experts, are used to better understand the theory behind leapfrogging and trying to see how the process is set up. A few of these experts are interviewed to further explain their thoughts, theories, and opinions about leapfrogging in Africa. These are the following experts:

Rebecca Winthrop is a senior fellow and co-director of the Center for Universal Education (Brookings Institution). During our literature review, we saw that leapfrogging with mobile technologies in education could be a great opportunity for Africa&#39;s future. Rebecca Winthrop has widely studied education and also focuses on leapfrogging. She has written the book &#39;Leapfrogging Inequality&#39; and many papers about education, education in Africa and leapfrogging. Since she is an expert on the topic, we have reached out to see if we could conduct an interview. Fortunately, and thankfully, we had the opportunity to conduct this interview. Rebecca Winthrop is from the United States of America, so because of the distance we have conducted this interview via Zoom. Beforehand we had generated an interview guide and afterwards we have transcribed this interview. Those documents can be read in appendix 1 and 2.

Keun Lee is professor of economics at the Seoul National University and co-author of several books about leapfrogging in Asia and economic catch-up. His published paper on the &quot;economics of technological leapfrogging&quot; helped us with the shaping of leapfrogging. During our research we saw that Keun Lee had lined up a good theory about leapfrogging, something that was very crucial for our research to try and understand the concept a bit more. Being able to interview Keun Lee helped us to better understand the origin and economic prospects leapfrogging brings. The interview with Keun Lee was done via Zoom due to the distance and for this we created an interview guide and transcript which can be found in appendix 3 and 4.

Mees van Deth is a Dutch born, Mozambican based entrepreneur, former war-journalist and fulltime philanthropist. In the early nineties, Van Deth was a self-shooting journalist who reported on the civil war that ravaged Mozambique at the time. After he saw the country falling apart, he decided to do what he could do help and build it back up again. Together with his wife, the acclaimed novelist Lisa St Aubin de Ter√°n, Van Deth has initiated and lead multiple social organisations. In addition, he has enjoyed success in several ventures spanning social property development, sustainable tourism, and infrastructure. Currently, Van Deth is working on his latest venture eVinci, a passenger drone service which aims to be operational in 2024. Besides Van Deth&#39;s technical and economic expertise, it was Van Deth who made the team aware of the term &#39;leapfrogging&#39;, which is why we are interested in his thoughts on the subject in relation to Africa&#39;s development. Please, refer to appendix 5 for the questions for Van Deth and appendix 6 to read the full transcript of Van Deth&#39;s videos, recorded for the purpose of this research.

The storyboard in chapter 6 highlights the key concepts of the documentary. The created documentary follows the research behind the sub questions in the same order as they are stated above, this does not mean the order of answers says anything about the order of the process of leapfrogging. The different causes or effects are not in order in the documentary. It can be seen as an interrelated network where these causes and effects are explained.

# 3. Literature review

To get a better insight into leapfrogging opportunities towards technological advancements and the various sectors in Africa, a literature review has been conducted. We will be explaining the concept of leapfrogging more elaborately, together with some historical aspects and we will focus on future possibilities.

## 3.1. The concept of leapfrogging

The concept of leapfrogging is the idea of the &quot;latecomers&#39; advantage&quot; (Lee, 2019). This concept is best understood not from the point of view of the actual latecomer, but of that of the early-adopter. The law of the handicap of a head start, as it is known, comes in effect when earlier developments propose a disposition to innovate (Lin, 2012). When capital has been invested in technologies that are being out-innovated, adapting is not always easy, if even possible at all. This could be due to being confined to pre-existing infrastructures, making adapting impractical or costly. In case of an earlier investment that has not been recouped yet, innovations might be stalled in order to make a profit on prior investments. In both cases, any entity (which could be a country, business, or even a single person) that has not made any of such pre-existing investments will have an easier time adapting to innovations that differ from past technologies. The idea is that countries wait and build capital and create the environment for mass production. The advantage of leapfrogging is the ability to skip steps of past stages of innovation used by earlier developers. Instead of catching up step-by-step and following the path dependency, they can jump right to present state tech, using that knowledge to create new ways of innovating. These advantages and ways of leapfrogging differ for branches such as ICT, health care and innovation. Africa is changing the way it thinks and acts, rather than striving to copy the Global North, Africa is paving its own way to creatively solve problems and think beyond the earlier created path. Problems are instead solved by practically looking at innovation and technologies rather than being bogged down with trying to achieve the existing Global North structures (Andersson and Axelsson, 2016).

Leapfrogging occurs when we use technology to solve a particular problem or to radically improve an existing process, such as generating energy, or even something as mundane as the ability to, more efficiently, find, hire, and electronically pay for transport using mobile phone applications instead of standing on a street to hail a passing taxi. It makes previous systems and processes redundant, such as generating electricity from ocean currents instead of by burning coal. It is inherently disruptive as it either destroys the value of &#39;old stuff&#39; and/or presents ways of doing things where it was not previously possible (United Nations, 2018).

Sauter and Watson describe leapfrogging as a more general concept. Their paper describes at least two actors required: The frontrunner(s) and the latecomer(s). The frontrunners are the ones pioneering the initial innovation (Sauter &amp; Watson, 2008). So, in for example the rise of telecommunication this would be countries that were pioneering the innovation such as the USA and the United Kingdom, though more generally the Global North. Latecomers on the other hand could be classified as being Africa or, more broadly, the Global South (Williams, 2014).

Being a latecomer, and thus wanting to leapfrog, can offer some tangible advantages. Leeelaborates and explains Perez&#39;s and Soete&#39;s (Perez &amp; Soete, 1988) ideas on the advantages of latecomers(Lee, 2019). They describe three different advantages that any latecomer has. Firstly, latecomers will experience a low or the absence of an entry barrier. It is easy to get started with the technology. Here one can think of existing machines or mechanisms with which one can produce or procure the product or service. Secondly, latecomers have access to an already existing knowledge bank. One does not have to use trial and error, but instead latecomers can already learn from the failures from others. This gives an advantage since the technology or service will be more mature and stable than in the beginning. And thirdly they describe the possibility of not being locked-in by old technology. An example in the telecommunication market, is the legacy landlines that are present in most countries that adopted the landline phone at scale. Skipping this step has shown that these countries are not burdened by the old infrastructure. This provides latecomers with an advantage (Lee, 2019).

Though one does not simply equate one leapfrog to another. Leeoutlines three broad options any actor can employ to leapfrog. The first pattern described is called **&#39;** _path-following_ **&#39;** and aims to encapsulate the idea that often other actors copy or follow an existing path (Lee, 2019). This is often the case when a latecomer is not very late to the party and can still tag along the initial version of an innovation. Often in this case the latecomer will need to create its own market of opportunity. For technology this will often be in a low-end segment. The second one outlined is &#39;_path-skipping_&#39;_._ This method aims to skip legacy steps that are no longer needed and by doing so can catch up to current advancements (Lee, 2019). Certainly, with path skipping, the aforementioned advantages are very noticeable. The last option of development is called the &#39;_path-creating__&#39;_ pattern. The idea of this pattern is that a latecomer would create its own path and by doing so catches up to the frontrunner. This often through new generations of technology or innovation and allows the actor to pave its own way to the front (Lee, 2019).

## 3.2. Historical examples of leapfrogging

Leapfrogging as a concept is not a new approach, neither in Africa nor the world. Examples on this approach are therefore not new. An increasing number of governments in countries are putting leapfrogging as part of their innovation/growth agenda (Yayboke, Carter, &amp; Crumpler, 2020). This section will aim to detail further a few relevant historical examples of leapfrogging in Africa and will be used later to further explain how these examples have and could continue to help shape Africa&#39;s future.

Perhaps one of the textbook leapfrogging examples is one of the mobile telecommunication markets. Most of Africa has never had a huge infrastructure of landline cables for telecommunication. The costs were too high and it was not a priority at the time (Williams, Mayer, &amp; Minges, 2011).Countries in the Global North on the other hand have spent its budget laying, creating, and maintaining vast networks of cables. Nowadays however with mobile phones being very common and prevalent this infrastructure has become less useful in that sense. In Africa on the other hand, these costs have never been made, and Africa found itself in a position where it could leapfrog its way towards mobile telecommunication technologies and skip all the landline infrastructure. A continual advantage of this is that it is not bound and burdened by old infrastructure the Global North is stuck with (Ramirez, 2018).

Building on this leapfrog, two additional leaps can be described in Africa. The ability to communicate effectively with mobile telephones has proven paramount. The rise and growth of M-Pesa, or Mobile Pesa (Swahili for money), is a mobile payment system launched in Kenya all the way back in 2007. It quickly gained traction and by 2016 M-Pesa was already used by 93% of the population in Kenya (Orsero, 2019).M-Pesa serves two main purposes; Withdraw or deposit cash to and from their accounts, and secondly it enables users to transfer funds to friends, family, or companies, et cetera. M-Pesa has been co-founded by Vodafone and the Kenyan Safaricom. M-Pesa has also extended its reach to other countries. Partly thanks to this M-Pesa leapfrog, around 194.000 Kenyans get out of extreme poverty a study by Suri &amp; Jack finds (Suri &amp; Jack, 2016). This example shows the potential of a leapfrog; it could spark into another leapfrog in other sectors.

Another successful example of leapfrogging can be found in the rural desert grasslands in Nigeria. Many people in that region struggle with finding and drinking water. Thanks to innovation a local company managed to install and use solar-powered pumps that can run without any maintenance for more than 8 years (Lee, 2019).

With regards to internet connectivity Kenya has been keen on leapfrogging from little to no internet connectivity to always being connected through a partnership that Telecom Kenya has made with Google&#39;s &#39;Loon Technology&#39;. This partnership has started with launching 35 balloons with internet capabilities delivering fast internet to connect its citizens (Adegoke, 2020). Rwanda has also started leaping its way to mobile connectivity and has adopted 4G at a record speed. In four years, it has allowed the government to achieve a 95 percent coverage, which would normally have taken 20 years (Yayboke, Carter, &amp; Crumpler, 2020). This is a good example of not being burdened with legacy infrastructure and straight away adapt current, long lasting, innovation.

## 3.3. Future of leapfrogging in Africa

In the historical part of our writing about leapfrogging, various successful leapfrogging innovations have been elaborated. The main successes were mobile networks, telecommunication and M-Pesa. Leapfrogging can be done in many sectors as seen and mentioned before. In a book of the World Bank Group, various sectors such as agriculture, education, energy, finance and governance are focused on (World Bank Group &amp; China Development Bank, 2017). Since our historical successes of leapfrogging all have mobile technologies involved, we have decided to focus on the possibilities regarding mobile technologies. Mobile technologies can for example also be of importance in leapfrogging in health care (Curry &amp; Seddon, 2016). In the next part we will focus on future innovation possibilities in three sectors, in which we think mobile technologies are important and have great innovation chances. These sectors are education, transport &amp; mobility, and E-money &amp; finance.

### 3.3.1. Future of leapfrog development: Education

Over the past few years, there has been a significant growth in the number of mobile phones available to residents of Africa, and this number will only increase in the coming years. Forecasters indicate that by 2022 there will be nearly 1 billion mobile phones, which is enough for the 1.2 billion people living in Africa. The mobile phones will then not be that far developed with, for example, endless streaming, as is already largely the case in the Global North (Strickland, 2019).

There are several examples of mobile technology in education where leapfrogging has been used. Briefly, these are the following developments; the use of television and SMS technology to provide online learning tools for children in which materials and training are presented; a project by Eneza Education in which again SMS is used to administer tests and assessments and to track student progress (Winthrop &amp; Langford, 2018); The Tusome programme in Kenya where tablets and a database are used to monitor the learning progress of children, which is highly improved within three years and the Siyavula programme in South Africa where online lessons in mathematics and sciences became popular, especially during the coronavirus crisis (Klingholz, S√ºtterlin, Kaps, &amp; Hinz, 2020).

Looking to the future of education in Africa, leapfrogging has both positive and negative effects. First of all, a positive development in the field of leapfrogging in education. Africa is in dire need of new engineering experts. This search has been stimulated since 2017 by the IEEE in Africa Strategy in which they are currently developing the Smart Africa Alliance. This is an initiative where standard policies are being developed for information and communication technology to establish a single digital marketplace in Africa. The IEEE is currently focused in five countries including Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia, with expectations that these countries will be well developed in the long-term of science and technology (Strickland, 2019).

A negative effect of leapfrogging in education in Africa is the rise of the philosophical challenge due to the technological developments. This translates into the advent of new forms of dictatorship, not only by governments but also by tech companies in the future. Therefore, it is important that forms of education are created in which not only 21st-century skills, but philosophy are central. In this, leapfrogging in technology is not always of high value, but having a good educational infrastructure and as many young people as possible in Africa with access (Konneh, 2020).

In addition to mobile technology playing a major role in leapfrogging in Africa, there are other ways to leapfrog in the area of education. According to Mgcini Keith Phuthi, there are several goals that should be achieved in education. These are the following: literacy; elementary math; collaborative skills; civility and employability. The possibilities for achieving these goals and improving learning outcomes are endless and involve analysis and reflection. Not all of these goals need to be met with the use of mobile technology in leapfrogging. According to Phuthi, there are several ways one can leapfrog to take education to the next level. First of all, creating a comprehensive collective bargaining agreement for teachers. All over the world, teachers are underpaid and undervalued for their work. To raise the level of education in Africa to the highest possible level, a good collective bargaining agreement will have to be drawn up, in which teachers are encouraged to deliver even better quality and in which the teaching profession is promoted more. In addition to this, Africa will have to look at various trainings from other countries for improving the quality of the lessons of teachers. Furthermore, education in Africa will have to abandon the traditional examination system and start using the transcript model in which the progress of the student during the academic year is recorded. This will eliminate the snapshot and offer customized education, which will ultimately begin to improve the quality of learning outcomes (Phuthi, 2019).

### 3.3.2. Future of leapfrog development: Transport &amp; Mobility

In most places in the developed world, the most agile mode of transport service is by road. Due to well built and maintained and international road infrastructure, supply and demand can be met with certain reliability. In many sub-Saharan African countries though, this is not always as simple. Rwanda, a comparatively prosperous east African nation, has approximately eighteen percent of its fourteen thousand kilometres of roads paved, leaving many rural areas inaccessible when flooding occurs after heavy rainfall. Many services that include transportation are then disrupted and therefore unreliable (McManus, 2019).

The legacy development path of solving problems alike, as most developed nations have, is to pave the unpaved roads. Unfortunately, Rwanda does not have the financial capacity to simply pave the full one hundred percent of their existing road network. This problem with unreliable infrastructure is not unique to Rwanda, or even to sub‚ÄìSaharan Africa for that matter but is a recurring hurdle most developing nations are struggling to overcome (African Development Bank, 2018).

In this chapter, single successful stories of initiatives that have gone beyond path-dependent technological frameworks and have created new, unique solutions to their own unique problems are being explained.

**Case study: Rwandan company Zipline transporting medical supplies by drone**

A successful story that avoids path dependency and uses leapfrogging is the case of Zipline. This company has found a solution for faster transport of life-saving supplies involving drones. The process in accomplishing this, is explained below.

When transportations of emergency medical supplies are disrupted, patients are at increased risk of not receiving the care they need. One way to solve this problem is to decentralise the distribution of medical goods so that final distribution lines are kept short and less likely to be disrupted. The problem with decentralising, however, is that many supplies - like donor blood - have short shelf lives which would result in a jump in waste, and thus in costs. Instead, the engineers started solving this problem from scratch by going around path dependent legacy development. They asked themselves: &quot;How can we provide medical products in the fastest and most low-cost manner?&quot; Their answer was to deliver supplies by drone - and it worked (Flyzipline.com, 2021).

One year after their launch in 2016, Zipline already delivered twenty percent of the blood bags outside of the capital Kigali. After doubling their deliveries over the last twelve months, today in 2021 they have made a total of 200.000 commercial deliveries. Averaging one delivery every four minutes, Zipline carries out more deliveries than any unmanned aircraft system company to date. On top of that, they have managed to bring waste down to zero (percent) by working with a centralised system. When it comes to their carbon footprint Ziplines comes out on top again. Each drone, or Zip as they call it, is around 30 times more efficient than an average electric vehicle. In terms of output and waste, this makes Zipline the most efficient medical supplier in the world (Binagwaho, n.d.).

Again, it is the use of mobile technologies that make Zipline a success. Their founder even credited the cellular networks innovated by M-Pesa to be one of the building blocks of Zipline today (Rinaudo, 2017).

**Further future developments in this field**

The engineers at Zipline took existing technologies and used it to exercise a radical idea that turns out to be superior to existing services in the developed world. Now, they are aiming to reach beyond the borders of Rwanda crossing into Tanzania. They will build four more hubs creating one connected transport chain for the electric drones to &#39;refuel&#39;. When imagining this a few steps further down the line, in time an entire interconnected grid of Zipline hubs could be established (Stewart, 2017).

If regulatory powers allow it, this model could be used for other sectors as well. Amazon has been testing the use of drones to deliver their packages, though FTA regulations would only allow it to start trialling the technology in 2020 (Faa.gov, 2021). Companies like Zipline provide strong evidence for the technology&#39;s scalability, though it has to be noted that Zipline operates mainly in rural areas where airspace is relatively empty and population density is low, which minimizes risk of accidents. It is yet to be proven if this model works as good for city deliveries, which is what Amazon is now doing (Business Insider Nederland, 2020).

For autonomous drone technology, Zipline and Rwanda have proven to be a strong proving ground. To what extent the project&#39;s success impacts its wider juvenile industry is hard to say, though considering the exposure the project has had, as well as Rinaudo&#39;s former employer Google being one of three US companies authorised to trial commercial drone use, there are strong indicators that it has opened the doors for the technology as a whole to generate similar leaps of its kind in various other sectors (Grant, 2021).

**Case study: Mozambican start-up eVinci aiming to launch drone taxi service in 2024**

Today&#39;s (mega)cities are getting more and more congested as many older cities&#39; central areas are not designed for the large amounts of traffic passing through on a daily basis. EVTOL (electrical vertical take-off and landing) start-up eVinci is aiming to solve this issue with drone-taxis. As of today, the eVTOL market is expected to be worth over 1.5 trillion dollar (Hornyak, 2020). This rapidly developing aircraft is promised to be the future of urban transportation, however, as of today not one company has been licenced to operate yet.

eVinci&#39;s founder Mees van Deth is sure that passenger drones and drone-taxis are a number one solution for Africa&#39;s infrastructure issues (van Deth, 2021). Please, refer to the transcript in appendix 6 for his argumentation.

### 3.3.3. Future of leapfrogging: E-money and finance

In most of the developed world, and especially &#39;western&#39; countries, people and companies alike have access to digital banking, online trade and e-financing. In many parts of the Global South, however, this is still a far cry from reality. In eastern Africa, this system of online banking and payment seemed improbable for most day-to-day conducted business. This however changed in 2007 (Jacob, 2016).

In chapter 3.3 M-Pesa has already been discussed shortly, which allowed Kenyans to pay and transfer money by their phone, without the requirement of an internet connection and a bank account. Since then, M-Pesa has spread to many neighbouring African countries, as well as other Global South nations like India. Through mobile payment services like M-Pesa, the standard of living in Kenya has improved greatly. Businessmen, debt collectors, farmers, and cab drivers don&#39;t need to carry around or transact in a large amount of cash, reducing the risk of theft, robbery and violence. Also, individuals and business owners don&#39;t have to wait in long lines for hours to make their electricity and water bill payments because these can be made using M-Pesa (Ng&#39;weno et al., 2010).

While the transfer of money between people and or institutions is only one part of the finance sector, the leapfrogging strategy could also be applied for the e-money and financing sectors as a whole. M-Pesa might have been a success, but as opposed to the Global North, domestic credit to the private sector in South-Saharan Africa is still very shallow. &quot;Financial innovation can provide opportunities for leapfrogging in financing and make capital more efficient, risk management more targeted, and trading less costly&quot; (Kouame, 2019).

Since the introduction of M-Pesa in 2007, there has not been a leapfrogging measure or innovation in the field of Finance with the same scale and scope. At the same time, M-Pesa has flopped in countries such as South-Africa, where 75% of the inhabitants do have one or more bank accounts. For mobile money to thrive, it needs an underdeveloped financial services industry (Kene-Okafor, 2020).

The lack of development concerning E-financing in Africa opposed to the Global North to quickly develop and &#39;leapfrog&#39; when a new technology or paradigm emerges. Everyone starts on the same line, so latecomers are not behind. Forerunners are the last to switch to new technologies. This does not mean African countries should just &#39;piggyback&#39; of western technologies, M-Pesa has showed us that it is better to create a new path suited to local problems and needs, instead of following the path of the Global North. In the future, underbanked and cash-economy countries in the Global South and Africa will face new challenges regarding E-financing and E-money. But instead of the uphill battle of intensive process of developing nation-wide banking infrastructure, these regions can create payment solutions that leapfrog this step to give consumers a viable payment method for their needs of that moment (UNCTAD, 2018).

# **4. Conceptual approach**

In agreement with the outcome of the literature review and our methodology, a conceptual framework is constructed (see Figure 2). The conceptual framework is representing the different components and sectors concerning leapfrogging in Africa. The conceptual framework helps to define the key concepts concerning leapfrogging and helps to visualize this network. The relationship within this network is indicated through lines and places.

## 4.1 Conceptual framework

In the figure below we have presented our conceptual framework.

_Figure 2: Conceptual framework_

The research focuses on understanding the concept of leapfrogging and its impact on innovation on a global scale. Important to state is the impact it has on the divide and differences between the so called &quot;Global North&quot; and the &quot;Global South&quot;. In order to see how leapfrogging is applied, different sectors were analysed each with examples of successful leapfrogging projects. That is in this case; e-money &amp; finance, transport &amp; mobility, and education. Projects concerning telecommunication, mobile networks, and the company M-Pesa were studied.

Hence leapfrogging is an evolving concept, the history of leapfrogging with the applied theory is studied. Leapfrogging is a part of the path dependency theory and is strongly correlated with governmental policies. Certain pre-conditions are necessaries to make a successful leapfrogging project. Interviews with experts were conducted to see what they think are pre-conditions, what their take is on the future of leapfrogging, what do experts see happening and how is that made possible.

# 5. Conclusion

In this chapter a conclusion of our research will be presented. In the research, a few sub-questions were examined in order to ultimately answer the following main question:

&quot;_ **How does leapfrogging towards technological advancements affect and impact the growth in various sectors in Africa over the next decade?** _&quot;

First of all, we have seen that leapfrogging has been taking place in a variety of sectors, such as agriculture, ICT, education, governance, finance and energy. We set our focus on mobile technologies in education, transport and mobility and finance. In the next paragraph we will talk about the prerequisites for a successful leap and the opportunities for Africa in the next decade. Leapfrogging is a great way for Africa to invent new technologies, ahead of the &#39;western standards&#39; and instead of path dependency.

## 5.1. Leapfrogging and Africa&#39;s future

### 5.1.1. Education

Based on literature and the expert interview with Rebecca Winthrop, an expert in the field of education and educational development, a concrete picture was created in the field of leapfrogging with mobile technologies in education in Africa and what impact it has on education in Africa.

It was found that there is still much to be developed in education in Africa, especially in the area of technology. In the interview with Rebecca Winthrop, it emerged that the majority of the people in Sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to internet connectivity and computer labs or devices. In contrast, teachers have cell phones, which can provide an entry point for further development (Winthrop, Interview on Leapfrogging in education , 2021).

Firstly, there is a huge potential in developing educational software where the technology can consider that the literacy and numeracy level might be low. Right now, most of the technologies assume a pretty good level of literacy and numeracy, but in Sub-Saharan Africa the levels of those are mostly different. According to Rebecca Winthrop, developing in this area has great potential. One example of this is learning to read through a solar powered tablet-based experience, devised by several software companies. Secondly, Africa is in need for more entrepreneurship, for example with Tech hubs. Young people tend to quit their education, because they may not have access to good quality education. When young talented, passionate and energetic people are given the change, they can add incredible things to the world. However, Rebecca Winthrop indicated that either way this will take time in which to look at how to maintain and use technology well (Winthrop, Interview on Leapfrogging in education , 2021)

### 5.1.2. Transport &amp; Mobility

In the videos from Mees van Deth, he expressed his high hopes for passenger drones to be a mobility staple in Africa&#39;s future infrastructure. He explicitly expressed that the novel implementation of current drone technology, as well as the addition of a blockchain-based regulatory system is a strong example of leapfrog development - leapfrogging, as he named it (van Deth, 2021).

There is little peer-reviewed literature on the matter. Most articles we have been able to find are written as a PR exercise, or in the form of (quite excitingly written) news articles on technology platforms. Many companies around the world are investing in the technology, and all boast to be developing the future of mobility. One prospecting estimate projects the market value of the entire passenger drone sector to account for over 1.5 trillion dollar by 2040 (Morgan Stanley, 2019), however, there is little evidence to support such claims. It has to be noted that this projection takes in to account the global market. How much market value the eVTOL sector on the continent of Africa will account for has not yet been estimated (van Deth, 2021).

Based on what we know today, there is reason to be hopeful for Africa&#39;s chance to leapfrog over western standards of transport. Regulatory flexibility in Rwanda has already caused the first hospital drone service to succeed. In eVinci&#39;s case, the governor of Nampula (the northern-Mozambican province in which Van Deth&#39;s eVinci is based) has provided land which eVinci can use testing ground once its prototypes are fully developed ‚Äì a gesture that implies some degree of trust in its success. Though, once again, any claims that seek to imply a guaranteed success of the industry on the African continent have little scientific support as of today (van Deth, 2021).

### 5.1.3. E-money &amp; Finance

E-money and finance is an important sector for leapfrogging technology. Mees van Deth gives us some insights in his videos. He explained that in his society a lot of people are _non-bankable_. He is referring to people who do not have a fixed income, mostly are not registered by the government and maybe do not have a private identity card to open a bank account. M-Pesa, the mobile payments introduced by Vodacom has really been an outcome, herewith they really leaped ahead of Europe. It went very quickly and has been around for a long time. Everyone can pay with online banking, even children and it is also applicable for small amounts (van Deth, 2021). Another accomplishment from the mobile banking company M-Pesa is that they developed solar cell based lightning systems. With this, they were able to leap from kerosine based style lightning to solar panel based lightning systems. They skipped the electrical based lightning systems (Lee, Interview on technological leapfrogging, 2021).

### 5.1.4. Pre-conditions

To achieve the before mentioned developments in education, a leapfrog pathway was created by Rebecca Winthrop in collaboration with her colleagues consisting of four key elements, in which the first two are seen as really required. The first element is about providing both teachers and students academic competences and &#39;21st century skills&#39; where the second element is about the recognizing and tracking of these developed skills by teachers, schools, employers and school systems. The third element looks more broadly at addressing inequality in the world and tapping on the assets in the community. The fourth and final element of the pathway is about using technology in order to really change the learning experiences. Instead of helping teachers with printing, technology that for example can be used for automatic grading (Winthrop, Interview on Leapfrogging in education , 2021).

Keun Lee also gave us insight in some risks or pre-conditions of leapfrogging. As has been made clear in the literature review as well, he speaks of latecomers and frontrunners. The advantage of the latecomers is that they do not have much existing investments, which makes them more free to leapfrog. For frontrunners or incumbent it would be more difficult to move ahead to new stages, because firstly they would have to recover al the current investments. He calls this the incumbent trap. Another pre-condition that he talks about is research by public sector institutes to minimize uncertainties or risks in making choices with emerging technologies. Lee specifically implies that you need a certain prebuilt capability and have certain experiences, you cannot start from zero, otherwise leapfrogging might be too risky. Lee also specified a difference between advanced countries and emerging countries. In the case of Africa, Lee mentioned that leapfrogging is more about adoption over new generated technology on consumptions end, then trying to produce new technology based products (Lee, Interview on technological leapfrogging, 2021).

## 5.2. Further research

As mentioned, our research is focused on leapfrogging with mobile technologies within education, transport and mobility and finance, but there are more sectors where leapfrogging is taking place or where it could be a great opportunity. The research that we provided was about the leapfrogging opportunities in Africa. We recommend further research on mobile technology leapfrogging in the other sectors: agriculture, governance and energy. This way all the mobile phone technology opportunities for Africa within the next decade are explored.

We have researched leapfrogging and the connection with the key theme &#39;A global urban world&#39; and we have been focussing on a new innovative way for Africa instead of the path dependency in relation to the Global North. What we did not do in this research, is focus on the investments that leapfrogging can require, who are these investors, where do they come from and what is their motive. This could also be an interesting topic that would require further research.

# 6. Script for multimedia product

As explained before, with our literature review and data gathered through qualitative research methods we produced a small documentary about the examined topic. For this documentary we have made a storyboard to guide. This storyboard can be found below.

## 6.1. Introduction (2.5 min.)

Explain what &quot;leapfrogging&quot; is and elaborate on the research topic and research question.

**Introduction to Subject**

Length: 0:00 - 0:28

Visuals:

- Footage of Africa; The country the people. The documentary should convey the idea that Africa is not just framing. Big parts of Africa are very interesting, that contradict the layman&#39;s view of the continent.

Audio:

- &quot;_Africa is often viewed as a problematic region,  __But__  many entrepreneurs and innovators are very excited about Africa&#39;s prospect. Some even say that the next century is Africa&#39;s. Their excitement is mostly founded through the continued development of technology, internet communication and the growing excitement around the concept of leapfrogging. Though what role does the technological development really have? And What is leapfrogging and how can this idea contribute to Africa&#39;s growth?&quot;_

**Explaining and some theory **** Leapfrogging**

Length: 00:29 ‚Äì 1:37

Visuals:

- The footage here provides context on theory; it should complement it where possible, and where not show the interviewee; Keun Lee.

Audio:

- &quot;_The idea of leapfrogging asserts around this notion of frontrunners and latecomers. The idea is that being a latecomer provides advantages that the frontrunner did not enjoy. We asked Keun Lee, professor at the Seoul university to explain this idea:_&quot;
- Keun Lee ‚Äì &quot;Latecomers advantage&quot;
- &quot;_This advantage is then used to be able to skip stages of development as Keun Lee also explains&quot;_
- Keun Lee ‚Äì &quot;Interview What is leapfrogging?&quot;
- &quot;_For Africa_ _these paradigms are  __opening up__  in many markets. Though one of the most frequently mentioned paradigm  __shift__  is the technological revolution. Also often called the 4 __th__  revolution.&quot;_

Notes:

- Text in the bottom when Keun Lee first starts talking: &quot;Keun Lee&quot; (stripe underneath and then the function), function: Professor of Economics at the Seoul National University.

Audio:

- &quot;_This 4 __th__  revolution has started some time ago, with one of the textbook examples on leapfrogging in Africa.__ The emergence of mobile telephones. Africa has been able to skip the landline stages and jump straight to mobile technology as Mees van Deth explains to us.&quot;_
- Mees van Deth explains how the absence of landlines fast-tracked Africa&#39;s rapid adoption of mobile phones, as well as introducing mobile payments before any western countries made use of any such service.
- &quot;_You might think, what&#39;s so innovative about mobile banking? __ See, Mees doesn&#39;t refer to the mobile banking apps that we&#39;re familiar with. Through a mobile service named M-Pesa, people can __ actually pay __ one another through text messaging. Like the popular app __ Tikkie __, one can send a payment request, but instead of a bank transfer, the money gets added to the pay-as-you-go account of your mobile provider. Where __ Tikkie__ has only been in use since a few years, and mobile banking only really got off the ground in the last decade, M-Pesa has been in use since 2007.&quot;_
- Mees explains more about M-Pesa and how it developed before the west had any equivalent service.

What they do have is mobile phones. So, if you could find a way to give credit and data and support that existing technology through mobile in a way that supports that. Whether it is some sort of link projected on to a screen in classrooms, that I think could be quite positive.&quot;_
- _0:50-0:60: &quot;This doesn&#39;t mean that leapfrogging in education will necessarily take the same shape as leapfrogging developments in other __sectors.&quot;_
- _0:60-1:16: _Audio Interview Rebecca Winthrop: _&quot;But for me in education, its less about throwing out the legacy infrastructure that existed, which is basically schools and teachers, and more about transforming what that infrastructure does.&quot;_

**Possibilities in transport and mobility**  (1.31 min.)

Length: 5:39 - 7:17

Visuals:

- 0:00-0:20 Traffic stock footage
- 0.20-0.34 Aerial drone footage of Africa, vastness of space
- 0.34-1:31 Drone launch, blood delivery and landing

Audio:

- _0.00-0.20: &quot;In most places in the developed world, the most agile mode of transport service is by road. Due to well built, maintained and international road infrastructure, supply and demand can be met with a certain reliability. This is especially important when it comes to medical assistance and or medical supplies. In many sub-Saharan African countries though, this has traditionally been a problem.&quot;_
- _0:20-0:34: &quot;Due to factors as difficult terrain, rough weather conditions, financial capabilities and the vast distances between population centres, many African countries can&#39;t simply just &quot;pave the now unpaved road network&quot; as most Global North nations have done. Especially in rural and sparsely populated areas.&quot;_
- _0.34-1:31: &quot;because of this, entrepreneurs asked themselves: &quot;how can we provide medical supplies in the fastest and most reliable manner?_&quot; _If we can&#39;t go over land, we should fly in supplies by drone was their answer. And so, in 2016, Tech-start up Zipline launched their first drone in Rwanda, sponsored by the Rwandan government.        The engineers at Zipline took existing technologies and used it to exercise a radical idea that turns out to be superior to existing services in the developed world. Zipline has since expanded to other Global South nations as Nigeria, Ghana and even as far as the __Philippines.&quot;_

- 2:07-2:27 Verdict on predicting leapfrogging&#39;s success

Audio:

- _0:00-0:12: &quot;Leapfrogging provides a solution forward for African countries on their way to become modern, high-tech societies. This does not mean that leapfrogging is necessarily easy. There are certain preconditions that need to be met by a country to leapfrog.&quot; _
- _0:12-0:32: &quot;Examples of these preconditions are, an educated labour market suited to cope with rapid growth and changes, a shared vision on the country&#39;s challenges and proper governance. __ __ If leapfrog activities are not supported by policies that translate those opportunities into sustainable growth, then the jump will have been for nothing.&quot;_
- _0:32- 0:50: &quot;Leapfrogging activities can facilitate great leaps froward in the Global South. However, these are often still  __**catch-up**__  strategies at heart, assuming that the configuration of Global North countries is  __**the target to aim for,**__  instead of considering whether African nations can forge their own path via their own unique version of leapfrogging;&quot; _
- 0:50-1:23 Keun Lee_: __ &quot;It makes sense in Africa, because they have well invested__ ‚ÄØ __in terms of this__ ‚ÄØ __renewable energy resources.__ **‚ÄØ** __I have been to Namibia, in Southern Africa, former Germany. There were sunny days for as long as 300 days per year. Almost every day, sunny days. These countries try solar based energies compared to many countries in the North_.&quot;
- _1:23- 1:38: &quot;Enthusiasm for taking advantage of leapfrog opportunities should not distract African nations from what should be their overarching goal: becoming producers in their own right, rather than simply consumers of technologies and services developed elsewhere.&quot;_
- _1:38-1:44 &quot;Rebecca Winthrop is sure that African nations can path-create trough leapfrogging, if they are given the chance to do so.&quot; _
- 1:44-2:07: Rebecca Winthrop_: &quot;These young people, when giving the chance, I&#39;m thinking of somebody at Tech hubs around the continent, are incredibly creative on how they can harness technology to solve problems and society advance them and their colleagues on wellbeing. __‚ÄØ__ So, __ __ I think that&#39;s a really important area that needs to be focused on in Africa.&quot;_
- _2:07-2:27: &quot;Technological development has in the past shown to be a helpful paradigm to bring change, and this might well happen again in the future. Whether leapfrogging strategies will succeed in Africa or not remains to be seen. Though a foundation has been laid for a burst of innovation to happen. The success of leapfrogging in African nations will be defined by her own innovators, investors and policymakers.&quot; _

# 7. Post-script analysis

## 7.1. Reflection on the group work

The group for this project consisted of 6 students: Floor Buijs, Bram de Graaff, Nienke de Haan, Jesper Jansen, Jeroen de Jong and Nynke Meeske. A large group which could perhaps cause some chaos, but it turned out that the cooperation went very smoothly and in an orderly fashion. Once every 1 or 2 weeks we planned a meeting to brainstorm about the subject and to make a plan of approach. The tasks were quickly divided according to each other&#39;s qualities. An example of this is the division of tasks for fine-tuning the script and editing the documentary, where the women took on the fine-tuning of the script and the men the editing of the documentary. The meetings were always open and there was room for questions and uncertainties. In this way we were able to learn a lot from each other and from the subject with a detailed and carefully edited documentary as a result.

## 7.2. Value of the multimedia project as a tool

The multimedia project gave us the opportunity to explain a very interesting and new topic in a dynamic and visual way. Hence, we were able to choose our own method of visualization we were free to see what fits best to explain leapfrogging. Leapfrogging is to many people a vague and unknown topic and we thought that via a documentary we could best explain the concept of leapfrogging. Via this documentary we used insightful videoclips together with a comprehensive storyline. Next to this, we were able to talk to several professionals who talk about their specific field of work concerning leapfrogging and innovation in Africa. The biggest challenge for us was to define leapfrogging in such a way, it is understandable for many people while still trying to grasp the deeper layer. We wanted to explain our topic well enough to the viewer before diving in the more complicated matters and examples of successful leapfrogging projects in Africa.

Creating this multimedia product was a real challenge for us due to the fact we were all quite unfamiliar ourselves on the topic. This also was something that made it a bit easier to explain for our potential viewers hence we could really start from the beginning. We are very grateful to be to talk to professionals about leapfrogging to get further knowledge and use for the documentary. We hope to have created an interesting and entertaining video on this new way of innovating.

In the introduction of the interview, we have greatly thanked Rebecca Winthrop to participate in this interview. We have introduced our research project and introduced ourselves. We have explained that we will make a documentary and asked for permission of recording the interview and using footage for our documentary.

01:19 I2: You already know a little bit about us, can you give a short introduction of yourself and what you do for work?

01:27 R: Yes, it&#39;s very nice to meet both of you Nynke and Nienke. 01:34 My name is Rebecca Winthrop, I am a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution where I co-direct along with my colleague [...] at the center for universal education. The Brookings Institution is a think tank, which is basically like a university with no students, and you do your research for policy makers and practitioners.

02:10 I1: Thank you so much for that introduction. So, we&#39;ve read a lot about leapfrogging and different articles and different ones from yourself. So it&#39;s funny to see how everyone describes leapfrogging differently. If you have to put it to your own definition, how would you describe leapfrogging?

02:25 R: I would describe leapfrogging in education really as system transformation, there is people who describe leapfrogging in other sectors as skipping steps in a traditional sort of linear developmental process of whatever the system is that is being developed in and you can typically see that in things like communication where people talk about the move from lane copper wire for (online), you know phones, to mobile phones you skipped key steps. But for me in education, it&#39;s less about throwing out the legacy infrastructure that existed, which is basically schools, teachers and more about transforming what that infrastructure does.

03:18 I1: Okay, so you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s not typically skipping steps like some people say that it&#39;s the opposite of ticking off boxes and indeed be like more innovational and skip the steps that other standards do, but could you elaborate a little more on that it&#39;s not specifically just about skipping steps?

03:44 R: Yes, so I think. You know when you talk about the concept of leapfrogging, you know core to it, is thinking about tackling and solving a problem in a way that it hasn&#39;t been solved before. I think that&#39;s the general sort of spirit, but every sector is a little bit different and most sectors when they talk about leapfrogging, they are really throwing out the past. So in Sub-Saharan Africa or Africa at large and other places around the world now, people are not laying copper wire for telephone lines in Sub-Saharan Africa. They are not doing that, that is out and old, in with the new cell phone towers and mobile phones. In education I think there&#39;s a real risk with that narrative that you have to throw out the old, because we spend so much time in the globe, developing this concept of Human rights and every child has the right to education and then developing this idea of a school system where every child universally, no matter who they are or where they&#39;re born has access to school and sort of developing those systems. They don&#39;t work that great, they&#39;re not perfect, there&#39;s lots of inequality, but I don&#39;t think we want to throw out education systems, or throw out the idea of teachers. And I think COVID has really proven that point, even though I wrote this before COVID. But what happens when you don&#39;t have school, I mean parents can&#39;t go to work, women especially, there is a gender dynamic, women often take on the burden of the household care more and have less labour force participation, inequality rises 05:26 because schools are a place where you can at least catch the most marginalized and support them with a range of other services. So I think there is a real risk with the narrative of you can do labour schools, you can learn everything on an app, you don&#39;t need teachers which some people say and I disagree with that entirely.  05:42 So for me, leapfrogging is really about how do you much more quickly accelerate the pace of change, particularly around addressing inequality, by tapping on new ideas, but with really schools at the center and maybe that includes rethinking what a school even looks like.

06:00 I1: Well thank you so much. With our project we are also focusing on mobile technologies being used with leapfrogging and in education this can also play a role of course. Mobile technologies can help in certain processes of leapfrogging. Do you have any good cases where leapfrogging with regard to mobile technologies have been a success?

06:38 R: Yea, there are lots of great examples of how to use sort of existing technology in education. There are some small nudging examples which are really helpful where you have messages being send to parents and families, whoever the caregivers are. Perhaps the most, this is especially helpful for the most marginalized kids and just little messages. There was a study amongst very marginalized communities in the UK for example on this, but this type of study has been looked at in other places, saying &quot;hey, ask your student to study for their math exam on Friday&quot;. And just, it&#39;s like behaviour economics, just the nudging of talking of the parents saying &quot;hey you have a math exam on Friday, don&#39;t forget to study&quot; increase students performances. 07:36 That&#39;s one, another example is, there is a really good set of analysis come out of the World Bank looking at cost effect of interventions and if you use mobile phones and frankly online videos about the importance of school and the benefits that a young person would get by finishing school and you send those through trusted messengers in the community to parents, particularly in marginalized communities, maybe they don&#39;t speak the language of instruction, there&#39;s a range of reasons why young people are marginalized in their families, but if they&#39;re mediated through and their accessed often through mobile technology, they come from a trusted community member, that is one of the most cost effective ways of increasing the completion of school by marginalized students and improving their learning outcomes. Now of course, you can only... It&#39;s largely because they participate more, they attend school more, they&#39;re more motivated, the families are really seeing the benefits, it&#39;s often this specific information about if you complete school, you get more income or you are going to get a job if you do well in school you&#39;ll be able to do X, Y, it&#39;s really kind of specific information that&#39;s motivating to the families and communities. 09:11 So, you can&#39;t... you can only take that so far of course, because you would also need to improve instruction eventually, but there is a lot of room for marginalized kids to get more encourage, motivation and support from their families and frankly from their schools, to stay in school and do well. So that&#39;s why it&#39;s, I think, really interesting and cost effective because you can reach very large numbers at a low base point.

09:44 I1: You just said, &#39;you can only do so much&#39;, because first some other improvements have to be made first.

09:55 R: Well at the same time, I wouldn&#39;t say first.

09:55 I1: Okay great, well can you give some essentials that actually are required for leapfrogging to take place, like some tools or governance issues etc.

10:10 R: Yes. So we, in our research, me and my colleagues who wrote the book &quot;Leapfrogging inequality&quot;, we have developed a leapfrog pathway and we really looked at thousands education innovations and looked at those that were quite promising as well as those that were proven and tried to see, where are they making change? We had sort of four elements that we thought was actually really important for leapfrogging. 10:42 The first two would say are really required. Those are really making sure that the teaching and learning experiences people have, provide them with both academic competences as well as what we might say &#39;21st century skills&#39;. Now you can develop &#39;21st century skills&#39; through learning academic content as long that it&#39;s taught in a way that allows for peers to interact with each other, teambuilding skills, you have some agency over goalsetting, some of these lifelong learning competences that yet people do need to practice. They don&#39;t automatically know them the minute they graduate school. So a lot of it is about how kids are taught, a lot of it is ... mix of direct instructions and more experiential interactive social innovative paralogical approaches. So that&#39;s one thing that you do need. If you&#39;re really focused on leapfrogging and make sure that all kids get a really good education, that prepares them well for the future. The second thing you also do need, that I would say is required is you do need to shift how schools and I would say teachers, schools, school systems and even employers and those who are hiring young graduates recognize the skills and competences that people have developed. If you think about, at a teacher level if you probably need to make sure that you are recognizing not only strong academic competence, but you might be wanting to recognize and asses in track and support, some of the other competences and skills. Things like empathy, or active listening or cultural sensitivity. Whatever competences that school or system thinks it&#39;s important. It&#39;s best you shift to include recognition of those skills being developed, all the way through to shifting to how you can think about young people progressing through their educational trajectory. you could be quite advances on certain competences and take longer on others, that&#39;s the ultimate personalized competency based approach. Also down to employers finding different ways to really assess and see what kind of skills young people have, often experiential ways trying them out through apprentices, workshops etcetera. Not just relying on educational degrees to be a proxy for that. So those two things are big things that are required I think. 13:36 Two other things that are probably very helpful, give the scale of inequality there is in the world that leapfrogging can help with but maybe not required in every single setting. Are diversifying people and places, really tapping on the assets in the community. So teachers and schools partnering wherever it may be, museums, parks, elders in the community, employers to really enrich in school experiences. We saw a lot of that happening in mid COVID that could be quite helpful if it&#39;s done well. 14:18 The fourth element is really harnessing technology and data in a way that could really change the teaching and learning experiences. It won&#39;t be leapfrogging if you just use technology to do the same thing that teachers have always done, which might be helpful in saving time with printing paper, but if it&#39;s to do new things like automatic grading or teachers having dashboards to see where kids are, or, we&#39;ve talked about mobile phones before, or technologies that lets you access a whole new way of learning.

15:00 I1: Thank you, those are really great and elaborate answers. In the last bit we want to focus on the future of Africa and leapfrogging possibilities. Leapfrogging with regards to mobile technologies, to what extend is this a part of Africa&#39;s future? In the next upcoming years, what are the main leapfrogging developments that should be focused on in Africa?

15:58 R: I think there is going to be great power, I&#39;m quite taken, I&#39;ve been really pressed with work in organizations that are using technologies to help kids learn and I&#39;ve been on the board in the past of an organization of Imagine Worldwide. They work with many partners, including various software companies that have figured out how you can help young kids who are now literate, learn to read through a solar powered tablet based experience. This can be done with a teacher that isn&#39;t necessarily trained in teaching and reading but cares about children and makes sure that everything is going smoothly. But that software is big, because most of the technology assumes a pretty good level of literacy, not most but a lot. So really, in Sub-Saharan Africa there is a huge problems with foundational literacy and numeracy. So I think that has huge potential. 17:20 Second thing that I think is also really important and has huge potential, there is a huge number of out of school youth in Sub-Saharan Africa who are incredibly talented, energetic, passionate, would add incredible thing to the world, but they&#39;ve either not been able to have access to good quality education or finished their education. Many of them have not been able to go to secondary school or maybe they even left early on primary school and they don&#39;t have a lot of job or employment opportunities. So there&#39;s a big need for entrepreneurship. These young people, when giving the chance, I&#39;m thinking of somebody at Tech hubs around the continent, are incredibly creative on how they can harness technology to solve problems and society advance them and their colleagues on wellbeing. So I think that&#39;s a really important area that needs to be focused on in Africa.

18:27I1: In the first part you were talking about the literacy and a organization that provides an app to tackle this. Can you say that name again, I didn&#39;t fully catch it.

18:38 R: Yes. I&#39;ve been on the board of an organization called Imagine Worldwide and it works with partners. The partners are One Billion and Kid School. And those organizations where the two finalist of something called the Ex price in literacy(?), that was several years ago and it was really a big monetary price, different organizations competed to see who could help develop literacy skills in children in a community where there was no school and no access to education. Imagine Worldwide is trying to help scale that idea and technology. That I think is really important.

19:32 I2: I was wondering if you think that COVID has a positive effect on leapfrogging education or a negative effect on leapfrogging education, how does it affect the skills?

20:18 R: I think that COVID has really had a mixed impact. First off, it&#39;s incredibly hard on teachers. There is such a big diversity of skills and competences of young people who have been at home learning for school for so long. Some barely had anything and they are also on the same grade with those who have had parents at home who education levels or time opportunities to help them progress. So that&#39;s really hard for teachers. Then there is the mental health for kids who have been home for so long and it&#39;s been very hard on marginalized families, the burden of COVID and poverty. I think that&#39;s incredibly hard, so that&#39;s a bad impact of COVID and we know inequality is massively up. At the same time, if there is a silver lining, I think there is more openness and recognition to the actors, the third and fourth bucket of leapfrogging, the diversifying of people and places, so we see that when COVID started, lots of partners started showing up. Whether they are family, media companies, news agencies, mobile companies, local community, outdoor sort of non-profits organizations really leaning in and helping educate kids. That is great energy if we could harness it well and really in a helpful way feed this school project and not be distracting. But that&#39;s an opportunity to really leapfrog. And then the second one, is that fourth bucket for leapfrogging which is harnessing technology. I think there is less fear about technology inside the education systems around the world now, because they had to move over. What they need is probably more time, time to think how do we maintain and use technology well now that kids are back. But I think that will ultimately end up being positive in terms of teachers being able to access just a broader array of learning materials and learning experiences. Even when it&#39;s zooming in professional employers into your classroom when you&#39;re studying a topic, to bring it alive for kids. That&#39;s a great simple technology thing that can afford you. I think ultimately that would be positive. So I think it&#39;s... Ultimately where it ends, I&#39;m not sure, depends on how much people lean into those leapfrog opportunities.

23:16 I2: Are countries in the Global North, on this matter an example for countries in Africa? Like is there a huge difference now, on for example zooming in the teachers in a classroom, between countries in Africa and countries in the Global North?

23:38 R: Yeah, in most classes in Africa, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, they don&#39;t have internet connectivity and they do not have computer labs or devices. What they do have is mobile phones, which teachers have. So if you could find a way to give credit and data and support that existing technology through mobile in a way that supports that. Whether it is some sort of link projected on to a screen in classrooms, that I think could be quite positive.

24:18 I1: We have been talking about leapfrogging successes and opportunities, but could you also give an example of a leapfrogging innovation that didn&#39;t work out or turned out to be less successful?

24:42 R: There are many examples of great ideas and innovation, but just because something is innovative doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s effective. That&#39;s okay, that&#39;s the game of innovation. If you have a 100% of  guarantee, nobody would try anything new. So, there&#39;s lots of examples in education, that just flopped and didn&#39;t work. One of the most obvious ones that people point to, is this &#39;one laptop per child&#39; initiative, but that did get a lot of attention and energy. I would say that the technology that was created through that initiative was really fantastic, they were laptops that were incredibly durable and sturdy, they could connect to each other, they had their own little internal internet so if you&#39;d have a couple of them you could actually have a little internet in your community without having broadband. However, it was really a hardware first initiative. So the hardware and the technology was good, without concomitant thought or training around, how do you use this educationally. Content goes on how do teachers use it, what are the dynamics in the classroom, etcetera. And that is often where we see technology innovations failing. So that&#39;s a pretty high profile one.

This was the last question, afterwards a thank you note, and some technical last questions were answered, and the conversation ended.

**K:** Keun Lee_ **Time:** _ 13:45 pm CET

_ **Place:** _ Online

[‚Ä¶] = Unclear

(?) = Not entirely sure

We started this interview with introducing ourselves, an introduction of our research project and the interview.

01:00 I: How would you define or describe the terminology of leapfrogging? What does it mean and how can we kind encompass and grasp this terminology?

01:12 K: Okay. So, leapfrogging, the concept or the word is not original from me. It&#39;s from the literature of [...]. My way of defining is that leapfrogging means latecomers doing something ahead of incumbent. Something often new, they&#39;re doing something new, or they do it combined. That&#39;s the one simple way of doing, defining leapfrogging. In the literature, usually it&#39;s used in the sort of context, saying that whenever there&#39;s a shifting technological paradigm, likeanalogue to digital02:00 , then latecomers, they do not have to bother to invest in existing technological paradigm, but keep that part, but jumping to emerging paradigm. Thereby, leap ahead of incumbent. That&#39;s the typically, how this concept is used in the literature.

02:27 I: Okay, that makes sense. You were also talking about, kind of latecomers, and I also read you kind of described this idea of latecomers and frontrunners, and kind of how that relates to it. You also at some point outlined that a latecomer will have some advantage that perhaps helps them on the leapfrogging, could you also elaborate a bit more on that? What kind of advantage do they have and how that helps them to &#39;jump ahead&#39; so to speak?

02:53 K: In the economics, when you say a latecomer&#39;s advantage, there are two burdens. Classical, all the burden is from [...], he is an old Russian economist. He said that latecomers don&#39;t have to pay for the R&amp;D cost. They just install physical capital from advanced countries, without having to pay for all the costs to develop it. 03:21 That&#39;s thetraditional concept of latecomer&#39;s advantages. While in our context, more modern contemporary context, advantage of latecomers in leapfrogging, specifically is that latecomers do not have much existing investment into existing paradigm. So they are more light, they are more free. Whereas incumbent, they invest so much money into 03:48 current investment of paradigm. So they would be the last one to move into a new paradigm, because they have to recover all the investment. As a trap. So that&#39;s what&#39;s often called an incumbent trap. 04:08 So the frontrunners often for instance are incumbent trapped, meaning staying the years in paradigm to long. So that time is took advantage by latecomers, take a lead, whereas incumbent stay too long with the old paradigm.

04:29 I: I see. Can you also perhaps provide some examples of where leapfrogging has been quite successful? And we were also wondering if there are examples where perhaps leapfrogging, had kind of tried, but perhaps hasn&#39;t been so successful or hasn&#39;t kind of produced the results that the strategics in the companies wanted to get out of it?

04:56 K: Most example I often useis in the context of a paradigm shift from analogue to digital technology. Specially in the case of mobile phone or television. So, when there is a paradigm change from analogue television to digital television. Incumbent [...], Japanese Sony, so they also even developed analogue based high definition tv and that&#39;s around 1990. That&#39;s the period that digital technology is emerging. 05:41 So some small company in US said that they developed basic architecture, which makes detail broadcasting possible. So that&#39;s the begin of detailed technology based television. Then it is current company, pick up this, this event, then tried to develop full architecture for system for detailed television. So, among the two choices, whether could have followed, Sony initiated analogue based high definition tv, or trying to target emerging digitally based high definition tv between these two, current companies like Samsung and LG decide to choose for digitally based television. 06:32 So they leapfrog ahead of Japan into digital television and broadcasting. That&#39;s the being of Samsung going ahead of Sony, otherwise Samsung would always be behind Sony and keep following Sony. With this new technology, frontrunners now become latecomers, latecomers become frontrunners.

07:03 I: Yeah exactly, where it kind of switches around between the two actives there.

07:09 K: In the context of Africa, one example I often use is that, in Kenya the mobile banking company M-Pesa, developed solar cell based lightning system. So, you do this, rural households in Kenya were able to make jump from kerosine based all the style lightning, by paste electric based lightning, by jumping to this solar panel based lightning system. That&#39;s also leapfrogging. Although the [...] developed this system, it is some local foreign jointed team, who developed this system and devices.

08:02 I: Yeah exactly, we&#39;re also talking about that in our script. One of the things that also kind of relates to that is, our research also points out that there are certain pre-conditions that need to be in place for these kind of developments to happen and you were also talking about that a bit. Could you perhaps elaborate what kind of pre-conditions need to be in place?

08:26 So, in the case of the example I gave in the television technology for the grand company, people they try leapfrogging to detailed tv [...], they&#39;ve experienced about producing all television in analogue system. So thereby experienced matrixing tv sent(?) So, in the sense they didn&#39;t start from zero, they have all of these certain experiences. Otherwise leapfrogging might be too risky. Because you&#39;re going ahead of incumbent. 09:01 That&#39;s why leapfrogging often required certain preparable(?) prebuilt capability. Also, you might want to [...] with the right patterns. Like, the Korean and the US, venture company walk together. Also, usually... Yeah that&#39;s the kind of pre-condition. And you can also talk about risks, there are risks involved in leapfrogging, can I talk about that too now?

09:33 I: Yeah, that was definitely one of the things that we wanted to talk about. The risks for smaller companies and the bigger companies.

09:43 K: Most typical risk is that at the main zone, because you are doing something that already, in time, so you might make losses for, in the first years. Because marketing might be too small to soon. And, there&#39;s no polar(?) market, so that&#39;s why often you need to be prepared to making losses a couple of years. That means that should be covered up by the big banter capital if you&#39;re from a company or some help from public sector. [...] optically, although right now all the electric car companies are getting substituted from government around the world. Otherwise, it&#39;s too expensive. So that&#39;s the example of leapfrogging requiring combined public sector subsidy, otherwise this might be too expensive, or companies have to make losses.

10:39 K: You can test this quite soon(?) soon making mostly only essentially(?) making some traffic(?). It has been making loss several years, so it has big, people get from the banter capital investment or some subsidy from [...] government. Otherwise, leapfrogging might fail.

11:00 I: Yeah, that&#39;s also what we&#39;ve read in your piece, where the government can play a role in just funding these kind of companies. Do you see the government playing any other role? Or is it purely a financial stimulation or other factors that might need to be in place?

11:19 K: Another role can be talked about in terms of the role by public sector is such lapse. Because another risks involved in leapfrogging is that you&#39;re not sure whether you are making the right choices amongst several other choices(?). It&#39;d be too early. So if the technology stand down or specificize(?), you don&#39;t know which technology will be prevailing eventually. So, those uncertainties to be, can be minimized if there&#39;s some doing(?) 11:54 research by public sector research institute, because they know trend of technology, what&#39;s going on and they can do some foresight analysis on. So, it would do public sector in such laps help. Prior companies might be able to minimize uncertainties or risks in making choices among several emerging technologies.

12:24 I: One thing you also eluded to, was this kind of notion of &#39;oh we&#39;re choosing the right path&#39;, which is obviously a question. In one of the pieces we read from you, you also talk about different paths, for example like a stage skipping or a following approach. What&#39;s the best option in these kind of shifts and what has proven to most oftenly to a successful outcome?

12:53 K: So, another way to reduce those uncertainties, is to make more friends(?) So, you should make more, a better team. So, more ident adopt sustained technology(?). There might be collective learning, there might be a collectivist economist key(?). So, the course can go down quickly than otherwise, so it&#39;s important to have some right partnership or lenses(?) 13:24 Is this role in reducing uncertainties.

13:31 I: We&#39;ve kind of been going back and forth on the script obviously, but one thing we&#39;ve also been interested in is continental or regional differences. Have you found that in some areas where perhaps leapfrogging is more successful than other areas? And are they the regions that we&#39;ve talked about already or are there regional differences that might be vital for the success of a project? Specifically comparing Africa to Asia for example?

14:09 K: I&#39;m not sure this is a perfect answer but maybe there might be some difference in terms of actual content of leapfrogging between advanced countries, emerging countries or least developed continents like Africa. In the case of Africa, leapfrogging might be more evolving like consumers making choices, rather than producers trying to produce new technology based products. 14:46 So at the major case, this, the solar cell based lightning is basically market or consumers adoption of new technology. Whereas product itself was developed by some other parties. So, in the case of Africa, they have a somewhat weak production capability. So, leapfrogging is just adoption over new generated technology by mostly consumptions end. The industry developed by, in the same continent.

15:35 I: One thing that we were also wondering about is perhaps zooming in a little bit more on Africa. We have been reading a few, kind of these, government development plans and some of them have started mentioning leapfrogging as a strategy for development of these countries. Have you seen how these governments approach that? How do they make that from in-depth plan to a [...] reality on the ground? Do you have any experience in that, how they, these governments approach these development strategies?

16:11 K: I think there is several examples, even the agriculture, which involves geotechnical technology. There are some cases of leapfrogging in Burkina Faso, also in the case about some other African countries. They have for example skipping old technology, by trying to adopt more solar energy based application in many diverse contexts. In lightning, but also water supply, many types of applications using solar or wind and sun. Rather than waiting to diffuse all those styles of energies. So, it makes sense in, especially in Africa, because they have really well, undoubted, 17:18 in terms of this renewable energy resources. I have been to Namibia, in Southern Africa, former Germany. There were sunny days for as long as 300 days per year. Almost every day, sunny days. These countries try solar based energies compared to many countries in the North.

17:47 I: Yeah, that makes sense, to make use of those resources that you have, for sure.

17:52 K: Solar can be used to many types of activities and obligations, [...].

17:59 I: That makes a lot of sense, for sure. Then we&#39;re kind of getting to the last section. We were also wondering what&#39;s the future. Are there any interesting developments that might lean itself well for leapfrogging do you think? That are happening right now.

18:17 K: Right now in the, one example might be the October market(?) Nowadays, the leapfrogging happens very fast. From a gasoline car to the electric car. China was [...] in car technology. So, they&#39;re kind of bypassing that into jump ahead with the electric car. So it becomes the biggest market in... So, this reach from gasoline to electric car, some are happening much faster than we expected, nowadays. So leapfrogging usually starting very slow, some ideas, but once they get vinum(?), they suddenly skyrocket. That&#39;s a very important feature of leapfrogging. So, sometimes(?) they might be [...] they&#39;re too late. There&#39;s too long between the hybrid systems.

19:10 I: Yeah, it&#39;s really catching on that paradigm shift and then being quick to take [...]

19:17 K: [...]

19:24 I: If we zoom into Africa, do you see specific cases that might be applicable there? You&#39;ve mentioned solar power and making more use of that. Are there other current trends in Africa specifically that you think...

19:36 K: Many cases using the IT services up there(?)So, at the main [...] mobile banking is quite popular, even before all the banking spread in Africa because Africa don&#39;t have infrastructure. Physical infrastructure to spread or regulate the online(?) banking to coast areas, so you search a more natural system of mobile banking(?). Many of such things could be happening, if you search and try, there are many cases of leapfrogging, very a lot are in Africa with leapfrogging(?).

20:17 I: The final question to close it off is, what do you see as a way of development. Can leapfrogging really be used as an effective way to develop a country, like countries like Africa, where there isn&#39;t.. Not all the infrastructure is there as you&#39;ve mentioned, is it a valid way to have it as an approach for development?

20:39 K: Yeah, because multiple countries, they&#39;ve already developed so defined infrastructure. Which doesn&#39;t, could fit in the new technology and sun(?) Not because, almost nothing thought they are ready to adopt it(?) So, in this sense, Africa&#39;s advantage of adopting new infrastructure, new technology, without much destroying existing infrastructure and so on. So that&#39;s one of the big advantages.

21:14 I: One of the examples we&#39;ve also seen is this idea of the landline cables being not present there, so they were quickly able to adapt a lot of the mobile phones where they were using the M-Pesa, the mobile money, to skip past that whole stage and use 3G straight away. So, that&#39;s perhaps a good example of what they&#39;re doing there.

Then the interview came to an end and Keun Lee was greatly thanked for his input.

## Appendix 5: Interview guide Mees van Deth

When we approached Mees van Deth for an interview, he was very enthusiastic about this. However, he brought to our attention that his internet connection probably will not be stable enough for an online meeting. The alternative was that he would record himself, explaining the topics that we were interested in. For this, we have formulated a number of questions which can be seen below.

_ **Topic 1: Introduction to the concept of leapfrogging** _ **  **

- How would you define the term &#39;leapfrogging&#39;?
  - A strong one or two-sentence explanation of Leapfrogging (also known as &#39;de wet van de remmende voorsprong&#39;) would get the viewer to understand what the concept is. The idea behind this question is that it will help us in the documentary, perhaps to help the user understand the terminology. It also serves as a way to introduce and start the interview.

- Where does your company eVinci relate to the concept of leapfrogging?
  - With this question we explain to our viewers what parts of the technology behind eVinci in respect to its position in northern Mozambique existing infrastructure. In what ways does it innovate beyond western standards?

_ **Topic 2: Current situation in Mozambique and eVinci** _

- In relation to Mozambique&#39;s geography and current day transportation infrastructure, why does northern Mozambique lend itself to the implementation of new drone technologies?
  - If you find northern Mozambique too narrow of a frame to provide answer to this question, please feel free to expand its lens to the whole of Mozambique, or southeast Africa, or even developing regions around the world.

- What is the initial intended clientele eVinci aims to cater for? What can be said about the demand eVinci aims to supply? (tourists, growing business, et cetera)

- What are some of the prerequisites for external factors eVinci needs in order to be successful?
  - With this question we aim to unfold what some of the determining factors will be for a start-up as eVinci to succeed. Not in terms of its own technology and capabilities, but in relation to external factors. A few examples we can think of (but are in no way exhaustive for eVinci in particular) are: the state of the region&#39;s governance (and possible weaknesses like corruption), the availability of skilled workers, the willingness to invest in novel technologies that eVinci uses, the political stability of a country, internet networks, pre-existing infrastructure, business opportunity in the region, other local and region factors that are at play, et cetera.

_ **Topic 3: Future situation of leapfrogging in Africa** _

- Is leapfrogging a part of Africa&#39;s future according to you?
  - Is leapfrogging a good sustainable development method to further develop Africa? (Compared to the Global North?)

- How do you expect the concept of leapfrogging to further push Africa&#39;s innovation?

## Appendix 6: Transcript of videos Mees van Deth

Beneath you will find the transcripts of the two videos that Mees van Deth has sent.

**First video**

Good day! Welcome in North-Mozambique. We&#39;re going to talk about leapfrog development. What is, in my opinion, leapfrog development? I think it&#39;s about development where certain phases in the technology steps forward and be jumped over and how is that possible? Well, I like to explain that with a little example like the introduction on mobile telephone and Africa in general. Because when they in Europe they still had to go in phases of all this copper wire that was still in the ground. The contact have to be ended, the contract had to be paid of for all this copper that is laying around. In Africa, when they started this mobile telephone, it was not needed, because there was no copper wire in the ground, people had no telephone, only some big companies and government buildings, they had telephone. So when the wireless telephone and also internet started they immediately jumped over that part of chaos. That is an enormous jump and that is an enormous saving of money. So that is a very clear example. But also I can mention here, the introduction of banking. This was amazing! I&#39;m here 20 years and you have in society very big groups of people who are non-bankable, as they say it, because they have no fixed income, they have just simple huts what they build themselves. Most of the time they are not even registered by the government, so with our association we&#39;re helping people to get their registration, their private identity card so they can open a bank account. But now with payment, the M-Pesa introduced by Vodacom, this is just one example, it went very quickly. That people could just new amounts on the market that pay some cabbage, bread, with M-Pesa, small amounts. This was really amazing! And now when you see, there are a prompt of Europe. Because everyone had that, the children their mobile phones, they can pay with mobile payments. This is absolutely a fantastic example of leapfrog development.

**Second video**

The development and implementation of our hybrid, electric, little aircraft. I have here a little model to show you. This is how it looks like. It shows 2 opportunities for leapfrogging you could say. Firstly, situations of the road in Mozambique, secondly, the high-tech operation of the system via blockchain technology. So about Mozambique, a country 2 times the size of France, with only a 32 million inhabitants, the road situation, you could say, is bad. That&#39;s an understatement but the roads are going mainly inlands from East to West and West to East and North, South there is only one road still, what is now done up a bit here and there. But the transport openly, let&#39;s say the public transport, that&#39;s the word, is more less not existing. It is just some tour operating busses who drive big distance and then you have small mini buses for shorter distances and they&#39;re put in 2 times as many passengers as officially allowed and most of the time, the driver just bought his driver&#39;s license. So there&#39;s happening a lot of horrible accidents. There&#39;s one time we have 20 people dead, 30 people dead, it&#39;s just too &quot;shapas&quot; as they call it, collapsing with each other. So you can more less compare this situation with non-existing roads with the, in the corporation with mobile phones, the existing copper wire, the land lines that sit in the ground. So for personal transport this little aircraft will be perfect. Okay for goods et cetera you need trucks et cetera but then most of the time you have to go over mud roads, it&#39;s very difficult. Then the other scene, it&#39;s about technology. Mozambique likes very much technology and also they like always to meet each other. You can mail them, you can call them, but if you want the real business, you have to make an appointment, you have to see each other. Mozambique is really, they are not very into answering your mail. They say &quot;we&#39;ll meet, we&#39;ll meet one day, we see and then we can really do business!&quot;. So about the technology of blockchain. Here&#39;s a report and that say the future of aviation in blockchain, it tells it all. See it as, blockchain works directly, decentralized, normally you have in between organizations like tour operators et cetera. Here you probably would have kind of IATA organization who is in between and knows everything about air transport. But people can on their mobile phone, can book tickets and look if their on their way and if they can have somewhere jump on an air shuttle, we&#39;re going to call it air shuttles and do this 100 kilometers, 200 kilometers, 300 kilometers for short and middle long distances. Now that opportunity is, it can really go out, it will be leapfrogging.
